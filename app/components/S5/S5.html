                                    <li>Whenever you encounter a belief - whether it’s a core belief, a cultural belief, a hand- me-down belief, or an advertised belief - ask yourself, and then answer, these questions. I’m going to ask them in the context of how they affect your relationship with yourself, your family, your business associates, your neighbors, as well as the community-at-large. And dig deep for the answers. Plan to spend considerable time reflecting upon each. And don’t assume that whatever first comes to mind is the only answer. Here they are:
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Are these your beliefs or those of someone else?</li>
                                            <li>Are your beliefs based upon experience?</li>
                                            <li>Can you think of times in your life when your belief was challenged by reality?</li>
                                            <li>Have your beliefs ever kept you from achieving a goal?</li>
                                            <li>Are certain themes reflected in your beliefs?</li>
                                            <li>Are you willing to change one or more of your beliefs if they are obstacles to your goals?</li>
                                            <li>Are your beliefs serving a useful purpose?</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                        <p>You don’t have to wait. Begin the process right now by identifying a belief you would like to change. Pick one that is holding you back. Here’s an example: Better safe than sorry. People are afraid of failure so they play it safe in both their personal and professional lives. You must overcome this belief if you are to be successful. Any change requires moving away from familiar territory. And any learning experience carries with it the risk of losing face. No wonder people stay where they are. Even though their business venture could have the potential of doubling its profits, or they might unleash the means to spend more time with their family by doing what they really want to do; instead, they remain in the same rut. We hold on to a belief because we have become set in our ways, and we resist change. We may want to do things differently, but we fear change. We are afraid of failing. So instead of taking steps to improve our lot, we keep things status quo. We even create new beliefs to justify the rut we’re in.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I have a friend who services clients for a large company. His job requires that he log nearly 50,000 miles a year driving throughout the Eastern USA. Every hour that he is on the road, he is away from his family and those things that bring pleasure. He was recently offered a promotion that would keep him at company headquarters close to home. “No way,” he told me. “I’m not going to become part of that rat-race. Too much backbiting at headquarters. I’d rather be on my own, even if it means a lower salary and eating in truck stops.”</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Where does this belief come from? Perhaps from his early childhood. Many men are taught that they must be decisive and always make the right decision. Role models may have been present in the family or depicted on the television screen by our childhood heroes. Or perhaps through the pages of books read to us by parents. Subtle messages conveying what a hero can and should be were present throughout our early upbringing. What happens, though, when the child encounters failure and realizes that success is not guaranteed? Then the fear of failure may result in that person becoming indecisive or avoiding situations requiring that he or she take charge and accept responsibility. The person might seek employment in a subservient position so someone else can shoulder the responsibility for failure. Not only will this belief impact on the person’s professional life, but they may also seek a spouse who plays a dominant role in their relationship.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>While in some cases it might be necessary to consult with a therapist to help with the process, by asking the right questions, you can usually identify for yourself what is triggering a particular behavioral path. Often, just understanding the basic mechanism of what is going on and coming to grips with what the initiating event might be is all that it takes to initiate the first step toward change.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Perhaps your inability to express certain emotions is because of how or whether you were accepted by your family or social group as a child. Emotions often will be denied when they are seen as unacceptable to others. Consequently, you may repress an emotion through fear of rejection. A fear that originated decades ago when you weren’t even old enough to remotely understand the process now shapes your decisions as an adult.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Healthy people are able to acknowledge appropriately expressed anger, envy, or sexual feelings without imposing punishment. People feel free to discuss not only their own emotions, but to be available as confidants for others who need to express their own. A person who has been raised in this type of open environment is more likely to take responsibility for their feelings and not to blame others for how they feel. As a consequence, they will be more comfortable with other people, and with making decisions, even if those decisions do not carry a warranty for success.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>At Saddlebrook Resort, I teach corporate clients to accept the inevitable risks that always accompany success. These lessons are best taught in an environment where challenges can be created through realistic scenarios. Ours is a 5-acre facility, which includes a climbing wall, zip line, and other initiatives built high in the trees. The clients may be instructed to solve a complex task on the ground, or to get their team across a rope bridge they have to build across an expanse of water. Some activities may also involve actors to play the role of difficult clients or disgruntled employees. The participants learn to trust each other and to communicate under pressure. Our own research, as well as that of others, has revealed improved self and group efficacy immediately upon completion of the day’s training. Furthermore, there is an increase in trust, and a decrease in stress. Corporations improve their bottom line, and, by having healthier and more productive team members, their shareholders welcome this type of investment. Because of demand, we now are signing up families and engaged couples, who use the program to enrich their relationships. Why? Because it works, it’s fun, and it requires about the same time as a round of golf.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>You can take steps to overcome obstructive beliefs in your life without going through our experiential-adventure training. Begin by asking the Belief Challenge questions. You are the only one who can answer these questions. Write them down, and then read the answers out loud. Sometimes, when you receive information via multiple sensory modalities, it’s easier to process and to understand. Consider all the sources of beliefs that I have mentioned earlier. When asking if a given belief is justified, reflect upon previous occasions when that belief influenced your behavior. What was the outcome? Even if you weren’t successful, was the outcome really all that bad? Bad enough to prompt you never again to attempt to move forward? And while you are at it, which decisions do you most regret? Those you made or those you didn’t? Then list all of the ways your life may change if you accept the challenge of changing your belief and succeed? Remember, there is no single correct answer to any of these questions. But take the time to answer them. Collect as much information as possible. Perhaps the cost/benefit ratio will not be worth it. And that’s okay. Or perhaps you should chance it. That’s okay, too. You must decide on the basis of your beliefs and on the goals which they may impact.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Let’s return to the notion that it is a mismatch between your belief and the environment, which leads to emotional upheaval. You always have two choices. When you have a mismatch, you have the choice of changing the environment to match your belief or changing your belief to match the environment. Some people have a tendency to do one or the other consistently. People who are centered tend to view the world the way it really is, instead of living in a dreamlike fantasy fueled by erroneous beliefs. People who are realistic about what they want know how to go about getting it. These people are open-minded individuals, who will gather as much information as possible, and then they are willing to adjust their beliefs if they realize those beliefs no longer have value.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In contrast are the close-minded people. These individuals try to limit the amount of information that they will listen to, and they will walk away from any discussion of a belief counter to their own. Such people are constantly trying to persuade others of the validity of their religious or political viewpoints, without acknowledging any other interpretation. These are the people who are invariably going to experience emotions that are negative and destructive.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>But you always have an option. You can change your belief, or you can try to change the environment. Sometimes you have to change the environment. If you are being asked in the work place to do something that is dishonest or otherwise counter to your belief, it clearly is a good idea to change the environment and to get another job. Or perhaps your marriage has become so destructive to the well- being of you and your family that divorce is the only sensible option. That may be a very difficult decision. A bad relationship can be difficult to abandon because you may have a guilt-driven compulsion to keep returning to try to make it work. Such futile efforts may be driven by a belief that ‘giving up is always bad.’ Or they may result from an unwillingness to initiate change because, despite the turmoil, you are at least familiar with the status quo.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This happened to me several years ago at the university where I was working. My Mind-Body -based research program was regarded by my chairman as a bad fit for the Psychiatry Department I was in. I couldn’t understand that belief.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The program was well funded by federal grants, my students were winning national recognition, prestigious medical schools, such as Harvard, were implementing similar programs, and I recently had been promoted to the rank of Full Professor. The belief made no sense to me, just as, I’m sure, my persistence made no sense to him. I hung in there until the bitter end, trying in vain to change another person’s belief to be consistent with my own. I felt leaving at the first sign of antagonism would constitute failure on my part - a form of giving up. “There must be something I can do to change his mind,” I kept thinking. It took a long time, but eventually I accepted the fact that you cannot control another person’s beliefs or actions. You only can control your own. So I finally changed the environment and left. Afterwards, my only regret was not having made the change when the mismatch between my belief and the environment first surfaced. I still have no regrets because I learned from the experience, gaining insight about others and myself. All experience is positive if it fosters growth or new insights.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Of course, there are times when your beliefs are simply not correct. You don’t have enough information, or you are focusing on the wrong type of information, in which case it probably is better to change your image of reality. And, there are situations where it isn’t exclusively a problem of environment or of beliefs. You may not be able to leave a job in its entirety, but there may be things you can do to modify the environment and to partially modify your beliefs and perceptions so the match is sufficiently close so that you can achieve a higher level of emotional well-being. Still, you always have an option. The option of changing your environment or of changing your belief – or a little bit of both.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>“Is my belief justified?” You have to ask this question in every situation. The belief that a firm and swift punishment is beneficial may be justified when teaching your children the difference between right and wrong. But that same belief may be totally inappropriate in the office where you may want to encourage others to take the risks required to achieve a new level of profitability.</p>
